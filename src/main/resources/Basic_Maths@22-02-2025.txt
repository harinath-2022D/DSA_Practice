1) Basic Number Concept
=> about modulo operator
=> the time complexity of operation like division is happening then it is equal to log base 10 if you divide with 10

=> reverse number

=> check given number is palindrome or not

=> ArmString number 132 => (1*1*1 + 3*3*3 + 2*2*2 == 132)

=> print all divisors of a number

=> prime number -> exactly 2 factors

=> GCD/HCF Euclidean Algorithm states gcd(a, b) = gcd((a-b),b);

=> prime factors of a number

=> power of exponentiation

=> sieve of eratosthenes
